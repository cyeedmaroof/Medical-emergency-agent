Dispatcher: Yes, that's perfect.
Dispatcher: I just need you to follow my instructions now.
Dispatcher: Folder. This inlet and then try to press it.
Dispatcher: I see there's a big flash wound just above the broken bone that's sticking out, and it seems to be bleeding.
Dispatcher: Quite a lot from this flesh wound.
Dispatcher: So can you just fold this inlet and press it firmly against where it's bleeding on the flesh wound, but just try to be very careful with the bone that's sticking out.
