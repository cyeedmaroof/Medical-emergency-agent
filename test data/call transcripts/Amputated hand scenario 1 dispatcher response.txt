Dispatcher: 	OK. Please help your daughter to lie down on the floor. The ambulance is on its way. It seems that the injury is still actively bleeding and I need you to try to stop the bleeding immediately. Do you have a clean cloth, towel or something that you can use to stop the bleeding?
Caller: 	Yes, I have a kitchen towel here. What should I do?
Dispatcher:	Fold the towel and press is firmly to the cut. At the same time you need to elevate the arm. 
Caller: 	OK. My wife is here now. I will ask her to hold the camera, while I am following your instructions so that you can see what we are doing.
Dispatcher:	Very good. That is fine. You can press even firmer and elevate the arm straight up. Just keep doing this and do not pause until the ambulance has arrived and continue the treatment.
