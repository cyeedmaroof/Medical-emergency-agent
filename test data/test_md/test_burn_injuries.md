# Dispatcher response:
      Julia needs to soak the burn wounds in water as soon as possible, so I suggest that you accompany her into the shower and start showering in a relatively cold water for a few minutes.
      After that, just continue with the shower, but with water at the temperature around 20Â° and you need to do this for 20 to 30 minutes.
