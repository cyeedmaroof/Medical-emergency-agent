To revive a person who is unconscious, follow these steps:

1. **Check for responsiveness**: Gently shake the person and shout to see if they respond.

2. **Call for help**: If the person does not respond, call emergency services immediately.

3. **Check for breathing**: 
   - Lay the person on their back on a firm surface.
   - Tilt their head back with one hand on the forehead and lift the chin with the other hand.
   - Check for normal breathing for a maximum of 10 seconds. Look for chest movement and listen for breath sounds.

4. **If the person is not breathing normally**:
   - Start CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation):
     - Place your hands in the center of the chest and push down hard and fast at a rate of 30 compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths (30:2).
     - Continue this cycle until emergency help arrives or the person starts to show signs of life.

5. **If the person is breathing normally**:
   - Place them in the recovery position (on their side) to keep the airway clear.
   - Monitor their breathing continuously and keep them warm until help arrives.

Always ensure that you are following the latest guidelines and procedures for CPR and first aid.

To revive a person who is unconscious, follow these steps:

1. **Check Responsiveness**: Gently shake the person and shout to see if they respond.
2. **Call for Help**: If there is no response, call emergency services immediately.
3. **Ensure Airway is Clear**: Make sure the person's airway is free. If they are lying on their back, carefully roll them onto their side to prevent choking.
4. **Check Breathing**: Look, listen, and feel for breathing. If the person is not breathing normally, begin CPR.
5. **Perform CPR**: 
   - Kneel beside the person’s chest.
   - Place your hands in the middle of their chest and push down hard and fast (30 compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute).
   - After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths by tilting the head back, lifting the chin, pinching the nose, and sealing your mouth over theirs.
   - Continue the cycle of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until help arrives or the person starts to wake up.

6. **Keep the Person Warm**: If possible, cover them with a blanket to prevent hypothermia.

7. **Monitor**: Keep an eye on their condition until emergency services arrive.

If the person is breathing normally but still unconscious, place them in the recovery position (on their side) and monitor their breathing.
