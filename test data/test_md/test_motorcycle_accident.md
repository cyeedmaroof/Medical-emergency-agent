        - **Caller**: Yeah, she seems to be fine, although she's still breathing a bit fast.
        - **Dispatcher**: Yeah, I can see she's breathing a bit fast, but it seems like she's able to breathe freely right now.

# Dispatcher Response:
      Please just tell the person who is stabilizing the head and neck to focus on this and to keep an eye on how the patient is breathing.
      If there's any sign of the patient becoming unconscious to choke or to start vomiting, you must just be prepared to turn her over on her side and establish a free airway.
